= about rublo
rublo is a very simplistic blog engine. It lets you write posts in yaml and generate them as html.

== the challenge
I created rublo as a response to Enrique Comba's (@ecomba) open challenge to anyone who wanted to become his apprentice (more info at http://ecomba.org/blog/2011/05/15/the-apprentice/ )

It is written in ruby, without using any external gem or library, in a TDD manner and without using Test::Unit, as per Enrique's whises :D

== usage
You can create a new post by editing the post.yaml file and adding your info there.
You must at least add a 'title' key.
You can declare site wide vars (like your blog title) in the settings.yaml file

=== template files
rublo uses a rudimentary template system. All you can do is declare vars which will get substituted by your posts attributes. 
Variables are declared using the format ##attribute##. (e.g. ##title##)
There are 3 templates:
- post.rhtml for the post page
- index.rhtml for the index page
- posts.rhtml partial template used to create the index page
Edit them at your own will (and risk).

=== creating a new post
After editing the post.yaml file, you can create your new post by running:
ruby bin/add_post.rb

=== running the tests
You can run the tests with:
ruby test/test_runner.rb

== help
Do you like rublo? Tell @ecomba how awesome my blog is and how I deserve to be his apprentice. Do you think it is horrible? Then tell @ecomba how much I am in need for a mentor.
